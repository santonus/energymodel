To install the plugin, simply copy it in the "plugins" folderr in Eclipse Nsight's installation directory. Note that to use this plugin, you need have the following on/in your computer:

1. A CUDA capable Nvidia GPU.
2. A full installation of CUDA.
3. Nvidia Nsight Eclipse edition. 

Absence of any of the above will render the plugin useless. To use the plugin, follow these steps: 

1. Go to Window->Show View->Other->Other->Energy Estimation Results. A custom console would appear, on which all results are displayed. Without this step, you won't be able to see any output generated by
the plugin.

2. Go to "Energy Estimation" on the menu bar, and select "Prepare". The plugin will now generate the files it needs for operation. If you are using the plugin for the first time, it may take around 5-7 minutes during which, Eclipse might not respond.

3. To to project properties->CUDA Energy Estimation. Here, you can override any parameter that is generated by default. Then, click on "Apply".

4. At this point, the .cu program you want to apply the plugin on, should be opened in the editor. If not, then open it.

5. Click on the icon on the toolbar, or go to "Energy Estimation" in the menu bar, and click on "Perform Energy Estimation". The results will be displayed on the custom console.
